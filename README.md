# Chocoalte-Vending-Machine
## Chocolate Vending Machine Proteus Simulation

Simulation of an embedded system which resembles a chocolate vending machine using intel 8086 microprocessor

## About The Project
To design an embedded system using intel 8086 microprocessor which behaves like a choclate vending machine. The machine dispenses the appropriate chocolate based on the number of input coins and returns the coins back in case of invalid number of coins. For further details see the pdf Detailed_Report.

### Add the ASM file to the proteus simulation (final_design.dsn) and run the simulation code in Proteus.
